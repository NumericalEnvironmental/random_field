# random_field

This is a Python 2.7 script designed to produce realistic-looking spatially correlated random field, such a s hydraulic conductivity, for use in 2-D or 3-D visualizations and/or numerical models. The model starts with a set of user specified seeds (locations with a known property), adds to the seed set sequentially by postulating new nearby points chosen from a Gaussian distribution, and then generates a numerical grid using scipyâ€™s gridding routine once the seed population maximum is reached. The code is not mean to be geostatistically robust but rather an easy-to-understand demo that produces reasonable looking results.

The script requires the numpy, scipy, and matplotlib libraries.

The following tab-delimited input files are required (assisted with a tkinter-based GUI):

* domain.txt - grid settings
* params.txt - interpolation factors, seed generation
* seeds.txt - initial seed points (need at least one)

I'd appreciate hearing back from you if you find the script useful. Questions or comments are welcome at walt.mcnab@gmail.com.
